# LOADING
The project is not compiled into a single executable file, we've been running it in intelliJ ultimate.
Installation/setup:
Build the java project, and enable lombok annotations in your IDE.
Run npm install in the top level directory to install the required node modules.

Usage guide:
Run the main method in src/main/java/com/example/loadingbackend/LoadingBackendApplication.java
Run npm run dev in the top level directory to start the frontend.
Vite will output the links to the frontend, note that you will need to use (one of) the links marked network if you want
it to be accessible from other devices on the same network.

Relevant paths for the frontend are:
    /admin
    /instruction
    /bigscreen

The author page is accessible at http://localhost:8080/author
